# :ghost: MobCapturer
MobCapturer is a [Slimefun4](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/) Addon.<br>
You need to install Slimefun4 in order for this plugin to work.

MobCapturer is a Slimefun4 Addon that adds a cannon which allows you to capture mobs.<br>
This Plugin is heavily inspired by the Safari-Nets from the mod [MineFactory Reloaded](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minefactory-reloaded).

To capture a Mob, simply craft a Mob Capturing Cannon and some Mob Capturing Pellets.<br>
Take aim and shoot at any mob.

Currently only some mobs are actually compatible with this Plugin.<br>
But the mobs that do work work extremely well!<br>
The captured mobs will retain attributes, potion effects, fire ticks, custom names, their health and even entity-specific traits like wool colors and much more.
